<H1> OBJECTIVE </H1>
  
This project is focused on emulation of text classification tool for bulk emails and text messages that OSF Healthcare receives. Due to it being a healthcare organization, OSF receives huge amount of queries from patients, their families, general citizens and also spams. Naturally, siphoning manually through emails and responding to emergency messages is not only inefficient but a delayed response might even lead to severe consequences such as untimely advice about medication dosage or side effects monitoring.

This classification tool aims to not only reduce the time to reduce the amount of time taken to identify important messages but gives reponders room to answer the questions from patients or their family members with higher importance to priority messages.
